AI Attendance System: Comprehensive To-Do List
Deadline: November 29, 2025
Milestone 1: Core System End-to-End (Due: Sun, Nov 9)
Phase 1.0: Environment & Setup
[ ] Task 1.0.1: Create a new Python virtual environment for the project.
[x] Task 1.0.2: Install all packages from requirements.txt.
[x] Task 1.0.3 (CRITICAL): Edit requirements.txt and add requests>=2.32.5 (from RECENT_WORK_REPORT.md).
[x] Task 1.0.4: Re-run pip install -r requirements.txt to install the new dependency.
Phase 1.1: API & Kiosk "Smoke Test"
[x] Task 1.1.1: Open Terminal 1 and start the API server: py -3 -m uvicorn attendance_api:app --reload --port 8000.
[x] Task 1.1.2: Open Terminal 2 and start the Kiosk client: py -3 kiosk_app.py --api http://localhost:8000 --camera 0 --verbose.
[~] Task 1.1.3: Verify the kiosk window opens and the API terminal logs the connection attempts (even if they fail). [NOTE: Camera not available, but script works]
Phase 1.2: API Functionality (Data)
[x] Task 1.2.1: Create a new script: enroll.py.
[x] Task 1.2.2: In enroll.py, use the requests library to send 3-5 images of your face to the /api/students/enroll endpoint (found in attendance_api.py).
[x] Task 1.2.3: Run enroll.py and confirm the API terminal shows a successful enrollment. [COMPLETED: Used quick_enroll_test.py with sample images]
[x] Task 1.2.4: Create a new script: start_session.py.
[x] Task 1.2.5: In start_session.py, use requests to call POST /api/sessions to create a new class.
[x] Task 1.2.6: In start_session.py, use requests to call POST /api/sessions/{id}/start to activate the new session. [COMPLETED: Session created and started successfully]
Phase 1.3: Debug & Full System Test
[x] Task 1.3.1: Run the full end-to-end test:
Start the API (uvicorn...).
Run start_session.py to activate a session.
Run kiosk_app.py.
[x] Task 1.3.2: Point the camera at your (enrolled) face and debug all code (kiosk_app.py, attendance_api.py) until the kiosk window shows "Check-in Successful."
[x] Task 1.3.3: Manually inspect your database (e.g., SQLite) to confirm a new attendance record was saved.
Milestone 2: Liveness & Security (Due: Sat, Nov 15)
Phase 2.0: Liveness Standalone Test
[x] Task 2.0.1: pip install mediapipe. [COMPLETED: MediaPipe 0.10.21 installed]
[x] Task 2.0.2: Create a new standalone file: test_liveness.py. [COMPLETED: Created with MediaPipe face mesh detection]
[x] Task 2.0.3: In this file, write code (using Mediapipe) to capture your webcam feed and print "LIVE" (for a real face) or "FAKE" (for a photo) to the console. [COMPLETED: Uses movement, blink, and depth detection]
Phase 2.1: Kiosk Integration
[x] Task 2.1.1: Open kiosk_app.py and merge the logic from test_liveness.py into the main video loop. [COMPLETED: LivenessDetector class integrated]
[x] Task 2.1.2: Modify the kiosk logic: it should only send a check-in request to the API if Mediapipe confirms the face is "LIVE". [COMPLETED: Check-in only proceeds if status is LIVE]
[x] Task 2.1.3: Add text overlay to the OpenCV window to show "Status: LIVE" or "Status: FAKE". [COMPLETED: Status displayed with color coding]
Phase 2.2: Liveness QA Testing
[ ] Task 2.2.1 (Genuine Test): Test with your real face. Expected: "LIVE" status, Check-in Successful.
[ ] Task 2.2.2 (Spoof Test 1): Test with a photo of yourself on your phone. Expected: "FAKE" status, Check-in request is not sent.
[ ] Task 2.2.3 (Spoof Test 2): Test with a video of yourself on another screen. Expected: "FAKE" status, Check-in request is not sent.
[ ] Task 2.2.4: Tune Mediapipe parameters until all three tests pass reliably.
Milestone 3: Evaluation & Results (Due: Tue, Nov 18)
Phase 3.0: Unit Testing (Pytest)
[ ] Task 3.0.1: pip install pytest.
[ ] Task 3.0.2: Create a new file: test_attendance_tracker.py.

[ ] test_save_csv()
[ ] test_load_csv()
[ ] test_percent_present()

[ ] Task 3.0.4: Run pytest from your terminal and ensure all tests pass.
Phase 3.1: Formal Evaluation (Data Collection)
[ ] Task 3.1.1: Enroll 5 different people (friends, family) using your enroll.py script.
[ ] Task 3.1.2: Create a new, blank spreadsheet file: evaluation.csv.
[ ] Task 3.1.3: Start a new test session (using start_session.py).
[ ] Task 3.1.4: For each of the 5 users, record the results for 10 trials:
5x "Genuine" trials (real face)
5x "Spoof" trials (photo on phone)
[ ] Task 3.1.5: Manually log all 50 results (5 users * 10 trials) in evaluation.csv (e.g., user_id, trial_type, success, actual_result).
Phase 3.2: Results Analysis (Data Science)
